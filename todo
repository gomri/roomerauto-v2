must have
13	improve error handling function
9	make requests to api as each meta and buy all the rooms that come up 
7	handle reservation already bougth status
11	handle no rooms found status from api request 
8	create dict for api request meaning token and email (maybe allow users to pot token in if you cant always get the most uptodate one)


would be nice	
	check that the report that is shown to user is readable
	create config file 
	make flow readable
	check if reservation is smart?
	insert the error handler to each function in the buy flow
